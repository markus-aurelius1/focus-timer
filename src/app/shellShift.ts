/**
 * Moving the stage without animating layout.
 *
 * Collapsing the rail, or putting all the chrome away for the full-screen map
 * or immersive focus, changes where the stage sits and how big it is. Animating
 * that as padding and width lays the whole workspace out on every frame (and on
 * the Atlas repainted the map four or five times).
 *
 * Here the change of layout happens once and the movement is a transform:
 *
 *   the stage grows     the new layout is applied at once, and the stage slides
 *                       from where it was to where it now is
 *   the stage shrinks   the stage first slides to where it is going, keeping
 *                       its old size (the part that leaves is off-screen or
 *                       under the rail), and the new layout is applied when it
 *                       arrives
 *
 * Either way there is one layout, and what is on the stage reflows once.
 * Reduced motion, and phones (where the stage is the page), skip the slide.
