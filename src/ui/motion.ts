/**
 * The motion system. Every animation in the app picks from these, so timing
 * and feel stay consistent. The CSS twins live in index.css (--ease-*, --dur-*).
 *
 *   instant   90 ms   press in
 *   fast     140 ms   hover, small reveals, exits
 *   base     220 ms   popovers, content swaps, list items
 *   slow     320 ms   panels, sheets, layout moves
 *   calm     520 ms   a change of mode (entering a session, immersive)
 *
 * Use a *role* from `M` (below) rather than a duration: a role says what the
 * movement is for, and under reduced motion each role already has its quieter
 * form. Springs are for things the user moves or that track a changing target;
 * durations are for things that simply appear or leave. Only transform and
 * opacity animate. Exits are about 60% of the matching enter.
 *
 * Reduced motion (lib/motion.ts): movement becomes a cross-fade, progress still
 * moves, loops are off. <MotionConfig> in App.tsx reads the same preference.
