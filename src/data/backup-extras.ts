/**
 * The parts of a backup that live outside the main database: the short notes
 * and the Current Affairs reading state (both in localStorage), and the
 * publisher metadata of the articles that state refers to (a small IndexedDB
 * store of its own).
 *
 * They are carried in a backup's optional `extras` (backup version 3). A backup
 * without `extras` – every backup made before – restores exactly as it always
 * did and leaves these untouched, in either mode: it never covered them, so it
 * must not erase them.
 *
 * Everything read from a file goes back through the same parsers that guard
 * the live storage (allowlisted fields, length limits, active publishers only),
 * so a backup can add nothing those rules would not have accepted.
 *
 * Merging (a backup into a device that already has data):
 *   notes          union by id. A note's text never changes; a note deleted on
 *                  either side is deleted (the later deletion time is kept).
 *   reading state  per article: a mark (read, saved, removed) made on either
 *                  side is kept, with the later time. An "unmark" has no time
 *                  of its own, so it cannot win over a mark – the cost of a
 *                  merge that never loses a save. A local article note is kept;
 *                  the backup's fills a blank.
 *   articles       added where missing or newer; never removed.
